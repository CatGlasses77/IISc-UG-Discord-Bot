# IISc-UG-Discord-Bot
A (discord.py) bot for the IISc UG Discord Server
This code is probably of no use to anyone else, but feel free to use it if you have a similar use case. 
 
All it does are provide you with a basic registration system based on an existing list of names of everyone that should be permitted to join the list. (along with the ability to register others with a different role), and possibly some basic moderation commands. WIP.
If you make any improvements, I'd love it if you'd make a pull request.
